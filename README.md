# Plant NPK Deficiency Predictor 🌱

An intelligent system that predicts Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) deficiencies in plants using image processing and RGB intensity analysis. Specifically designed for aeroponics and controlled environment agriculture (CEA) systems.

## 📋 Overview

This project helps farmers and agricultural professionals identify nutrient deficiencies in plants by analyzing plant images and RGB color intensities. It provides real-time monitoring and recommendations for nutrient adjustments in controlled farming environments.

### 🎯 Key Features

- Real-time plant image analysis
- RGB intensity measurement and processing
- NPK deficiency classification
- Nutrient adjustment recommendations
- Integration with aeroponics systems
- Historical data tracking and analysis
- User-friendly interface for monitoring

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV for image processing
- TensorFlow/PyTorch for machine learning
- NumPy for numerical computations
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for model evaluation
